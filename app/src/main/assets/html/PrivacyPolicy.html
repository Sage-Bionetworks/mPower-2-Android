    <div data-v-318ae349="" class="container"><h2 data-v-318ae349="">Privacy Policy</h2> <p data-v-318ae349="">Sage Bionetworks (“Sage Bionetworks, “we,” or “us”) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit biomedical research organization in the United States, created to enhance how researchers approach the complexity of human biological information and the treatment of disease.</p> <p data-v-318ae349="">We have developed a mobile application (the “Parkinson mPower App”) to facilitate our Parkinson mPower research study (the “Study”). The Study is designed to help Sage Bionetworks and research partners understand variations in symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. The Study and the Parkinson mPower App are designed for users over 18 years of age, and are open for use or participation by anyone, whether or not he or she has Parkinson’s disease.</p> <p data-v-318ae349="">We respect your privacy. This privacy policy describes our collection of personal data when you participate in the Study available at Parkinsonmpower.org, or otherwise use the Parkinson mPower App, our use and disclosure of such personal data, and the steps we take to protect such personal data. “Personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person directly or indirectly.</p> <p data-v-318ae349="">Your use of the mPower App and your participation in the study are each voluntary. By using the Parkinson mPower App or participating in the Study, you consent to the privacy practices described in this privacy policy. The entity responsible for the collection and processing of your personal data in the context of the Study and the Parkinson mPower App is Sage Bionetworks, 1100 Fairview Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109, United States. Its representative in Europe is the foundation Sage Bionetworks EU - 271b Noorderakerweg, 1069LT Amsterdam, Netherlands.</p> <h3 data-v-318ae349="">Registering for the Study through Sage Bionetworks</h3> <p data-v-318ae349="">In order to access the Parkinson mPower App functionalities, we ask you to create an account through the Parkinson mPower App. To create an account, you must provide a username, a password and your email address. If you wish, you can also provide your name and birth date. We will inform you of the purposes for which we are collecting, processing, using, and sharing your personal data and we will obtain your consent through an informed consent document and process. You must affirmatively consent to participate in the Study prior to creating your account. To provide your informed consent, you will be asked to provide your first and last name, as well as your signature.</p> <h3 data-v-318ae349="">Information We Collect</h3> <p data-v-318ae349="">In general, we collect all information that you give us directly. For example, you may contact us with questions or comments and give us your email address and other information.  We only use such information to answer your questions.  We also collect information passively when you use the website and app.</p> <ul data-v-318ae349=""><li data-v-318ae349="">Standard log files and usage data. When you visit the mPower2.0 website, we collect standard server log information, like your internet protocol address or your browser type. We also collect information about how you use the app and website. For example, the pages you access or the date and time you sign in. We do not collect information using cookies, beacons or device fingerprinting.[CS2] </li></ul> <p data-v-318ae349="">Before you can participate, you must register for the study and download the app on your smartphone. . We will collect information from you through the mPower2.0 website as part of registration and through the app when you use the app for the study. Here is a list of what we will collect and when we will collect it:</p> <p data-v-318ae349="">As part of the registration you must complete the informed consent process and create an account. </p> <ul data-v-318ae349=""><li data-v-318ae349=""><u data-v-318ae349="">Informed consent:</u> The informed consent process explains the research study. You must consent to join the study. We will collect your first and last name, and your phone numberas part of the informed consent process.</li> <li data-v-318ae349=""><u data-v-318ae349="">Account creation:</u> You must create your personal study account. When you create an account, we will collect a username, password, and your email address. The mPower2.0 study is designed for people age 18 or older living with PD or not. We do not knowingly allow children under the age of 18 to join the mPower2.0 study. </li></ul> <p data-v-318ae349="">Once you join the study we will collect information about your health and wellness through surveys and activities.</p> <ul data-v-318ae349=""><li data-v-318ae349=""><u data-v-318ae349="">Health surveys.</u> As part of the mPower2.0 research study, we collect information about you. We will ask you about your health, medical history and wellness. Most of these questions are optional. We will ask a few required questions. For example, “Do you have PD?” These questions are required because we need to know the answers as part of the research study.</li> <li data-v-318ae349=""><u data-v-318ae349="">Data imports.</u> As part of the research study we will import information into the mPower2.0 app. For example, we will ask you to do a short walking activity. During this activity, we will import information from the sensors in your smartphone about your speed and balance.</li></ul> <p data-v-318ae349="">We will ask you to link the mPower2.0 app to HealthKit, the Apple health app. In this way, we may import information from HealthKit like your weight, height, the number of steps you take and/or your sleep patterns. Any information that we import from HealthKit will be treated the same as the information we collect in the mPower2.0 app directly. </p> <p data-v-318ae349="">It is important to note that we do not have control over the privacy policies or practices of HealthKit. You can participate in the mPower2.0 research study even if you do not want to link information from HealthKit to the mPower2.0 app.</p> <ul data-v-318ae349=""><li data-v-318ae349=""><u data-v-318ae349="">Location data.</u> You can opt-in to linking  the mPower2.0 app to your smartphone’s GPS (global positioning system).
